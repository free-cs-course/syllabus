# Syllabus

My aim is simply to put all my knowledge in Computer Science with my working experience into a complete course.
It will focuses on Thai language first as I have been seeing a lot of demand on decent skill developer in Thailand.
We have too few quality Software engineer. And the course provided out there is mostly a business oriented.
I want to provide as free and quality course as possible.
